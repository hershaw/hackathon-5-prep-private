    "# Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen so far that the key approach for handling text data is transforming it into a vectorized feature space. While this is pretty easy to do with tools such as `sklearn`, we usually end up with a **very** high-dimensional feature space, which is difficult to interpret and can lead a classifier to overfit, especially a classifier with high variance (remember the Bias-Variance tradeoff?).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, a common step when processing text data is **dimensionality reduction**. There are a couple of well-known algorithms that transform the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The most widely known are Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition. `sklearn` offers both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, in this unit we will focus on a different approach to reduce dimensionality, sometime called *feature selection*. We will try to understand which are the most important features (words) for discriminating the categroy of our documents. This is a more manual procedure, but much more interpretable that black-boxish approaches. "
